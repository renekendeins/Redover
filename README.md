  - Status control:
    - On hold (nobody is doing this task)
    - In process (there is somebody doing this task)
    - Waiting for modifications (the task was completed but it needs some modifications. Bugs? Maybe)
    - Finished: the task has been full completed. 
    You can change the status when you need it
